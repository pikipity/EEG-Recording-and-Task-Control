This script gives a realtime demonstration of the eyetracker
--------------------------------------------------------------------
While the script is running you see the current data received from 
the eyetracker and the point of gaze is displayed on the screen
with crosshairs and a circle in red.  The number of blinks is also 
calculated and displayed.

The basic screen appears as white text on a black background as 
follows:-

             Eyetracker demonstration

             c1,c2,c3,c4:40,40,220,200
                 PortNum:1
                    Mode:1 (On Demand)
                BaudRate:57600

                  EyePos:-320,240
                   Pupil:0
               Timestamp:1.634
                  Status:0

                  Blinks:0

   'Esc' for exit, 'C' for calibrate or 'R' to reset

The setup parameters for the eyetracker are shown first:-

             c1,c2,c3,c4:40,40,220,200
                 PortNum:1
                    Mode:1 (On Demand)
                BaudRate:57600

Followed by the returned eye data:-

                  EyePos:-320,240
                   Pupil:0
               Timestamp:1.634
                  Status:0

And then the blink count:-

                  Blinks:0

If there is valid eyedata, crosshairs and a central spot in red
mark the current point of gaze, otherwise the words 'No eye data'
appear in red under the 'Blinks' count.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
While the script is running you also get a continuous display of
statistics of the form:-

tracker vn.nn P:NORMAL Tim:00:00:07 Frm:606 Av:85.44Hz Drp:0

These values represent:-

  P: The priority class in which the script is running

Tim: The time in hours, minutes and seconds since the test started.

Frm: The number of display frames drawn since the start of the test.

 Av: The average frame rate in hertz since the start of the test.

Drp: The number of times that the display has missed a frame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The script takes the following arguments:-

function tracker(c1,c2,c3,c4,PortNum,Mode,BaudRate)

Where:-

    c1,c2,c3,c4 = Calibration co-ordinates c3 > c1, c4 > c2.
		  Default values are 40,40,220,200

        PortNum = Serial port (COM port) number 1 to 8
                  Default value is 1

           Mode = Eyetracker mode 1=On Demand, 0=Continuous
                  Default value is 1 (On Demand)

       BaudRate = Serial port baud rate 9600/19200/38400/57600
                  Default value is 57600

You may use any of the below forms of the command.  Missing values
assume the default setting:-

	tracker
	tracker(c1,c2,c3,c4)
	tracker(c1,c2,c3,c4,PortNum)
	tracker(c1,c2,c3,c4,PortNum,Mode)
	tracker(c1,c2,c3,c4,PortNum,Mode,BaudRate)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You can press 'C' to display the eyetracker calibration screen.
You can press 'R' to reset the number of blinks and the timer to 0.
You can press 'Esc' to exit the script.
