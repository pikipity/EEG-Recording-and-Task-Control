This script comes in two forms:-

starspal.m	uses PALETTE mode graphics.
starsrgb.m	uses DIRECT COLOUR (RGB) mode graphics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The graphics display consists of a moving starfield.  The stars 
change colour from yellow in the centre to magenta at the edges.
The stars can be drawn as different objects; dots, lines, squares,
circle outlines or filled circles.  You can change the type and 
number of objects drawn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
While the script is running you get a continuous display of
statistics of the form:-

starsXXX vn.nn P:NORMAL Tim:00:00:07 Frm:606 Av:85.44Hz Drp:0

These values represent:-

  P: The priority class in which the script is running

Tim: The time in hours, minutes and seconds since the test started.

Frm: The number of display frames drawn since the start of the test.

 Av: The average frame rate in hertz since the start of the test.

Drp: The number of times that the display has missed a frame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In the section below you should substitute starspal or starsrgb 
for stars.

You may control the type and number of objects drawn using the 
script arguments:-

	stars(StarType,NumStars)

StarType can take the following values:-

	1 = Dots
	2 = Lines
	3 = Squares
	4 = Circle outlines
	5 = Filled circles
