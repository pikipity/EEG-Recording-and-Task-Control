This script gives a realtime demonstration of the touchscreen

A graphics screen is opened on the requested monitor and a 
touchscreen calibration is performed.  The display then shows the 
location and pressure of any touches by white ellipses on a black
background.  The message "No touch" appears on the screen in the
absence of any touches.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
While the script is running you also get a continuous display of
statistics of the form:-

touch vn.nn P:NORMAL Tim:00:00:07 Frm:606 Av:85.44Hz Drp:0

These values represent:-

  P: The priority class in which the script is running

Tim: The time in hours, minutes and seconds since the test started.

Frm: The number of display frames drawn since the start of the test.

 Av: The average frame rate in hertz since the start of the test.

Drp: The number of times that the display has missed a frame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may use any of the below forms of the command.  Missing values
assume the default setting:-

	touch
	touch(Monitor)
	touch(Monitor,Port)

        Monitor = Monitor no. of touchscreen (0,1,2 etc) [def = 1]
		Port = Serial port no. (1-8) [def = 1]
