This script can be used to test cogent graphics performance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
When  you  run the script the screen goes black and four speed tests
are  carried  out; dots, lines, rectangles and ellipses.  These four
tests  are  repeated  for  8, 16, 24 and 32 bit graphics.  The whole 
test  sequence should take no more than 5 minutes.  During this time
some messages may appear on-screen as graphics screens are opened.
You  may  also see the line "Number of array elements exceeds 16384"
which  is  produced  while  testing  whether Student Matlab is being 
used.

The  output  from  the script then appears on the screen and is also
saved in a file named 'perfdata.txt' which you may choose to print.

The first lines of output give the time of the test and identify the
test program and machine ID of the PC as shown below:-

   perftest v1.01 17-Jul-2001
   Machine:mustard00 128.40.206.2
   GPrim v1.17 Compiled:Jul 17 2001
   GLib DirectDraw v7 Compiled:Jul 17 2001
   Display 640x480 85.40Hz

Then  for  each of the graphics modes (8, 16, 24 and 32 bit) you get
lines as follows:-

      Cogent 2000 perfomance test (32 bit graphics)
       Dots per second:126448   StdErr:87      
      Lines per second:32447    StdErr:31      
      Rects per second:60442    StdErr:999     
   Ellipses per second:9941     StdErr:3       

This gives the number of graphics objects drawn per second for dots,
lines,  rectangles and ellipses as well as a measure of the standard
error  in  each measurement.  The variation in these measurements is
due  to  disk  activity, virtual memory operations and task swapping
which are part of the normal running of the operating system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Once  started  you should let the script complete.  If necessary you
can  halt  it  with a 'Ctrl + C' folowed by 'Alt + Tab'.
