This script comes in two forms:-

equilpal.m	uses PALETTE mode graphics.
equilrgb.m	uses DIRECT COLOUR (RGB) mode graphics.

This  script  can  be  used  to  determine  equiluminance points for 
different colours using a flicker method.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The large  upper rectangular region  flashes alternately between two
colours named Colour 1 and Colour 2.

Underneath  there  are  controls  for  colour 1  on the left and for 
colour 2  on  the  right.   There is a square showing the colour and
then   four   slider   controls  for  red,   green,  blue  and  grey 
respectively.  Move the mouse into the triangle boxes and then press 
a  mouse  button  to  increase  or decrease a colour level.  Use the
left mouse button to change a step per click or the right button for
continuous  change.   The big triangle changes the value in steps of
10  and  the  small  triangle  in  steps  of  1.   Colour levels are 
displayed  as  a  number  from  0 to  1 by default but if you select 
'255 Mode' they are displayed as numbers  from  0  to  255.

You may also change the flash period in multiples of 2 frames.  Only 
even  periods are possible because the program displays colour 1 for 
'n' frames and then colour 2 for 'n' frames giving a period of '2n'.

You  should  aim  to  reduce the flicker to a minimum.  Sometimes it 
helps  to  desaturate the colour by adding grey as it can be hard to
find the equiluminance point with a highly saturated colour.
