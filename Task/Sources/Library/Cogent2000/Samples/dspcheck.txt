This script checks a display calibration file 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You can call this sample script in one of three ways:-

1/ You pass the function the name of a display calibration file, a
   'Levels' value and communication details for a photometer, and 
   the script will calculate a number of XYZ values based on the
   display calibration file.  It will then make the screen display
   each of those 'requested' XYZ values and measure it each time 
   using the photometer to get a 'measured' XYZ.

   It then displays a graph showing the difference between 
   'requested' and 'measured' XYZ values.

   The check data is also saved in a file.

   The number of XYZ values checked depends on the 'Levels' value;
   it is equal to (Levels x Levels x Levels) - 1.  So be careful
   how you set levels:-

      Levels = 2   XYZ values = 7
      Levels = 3   XYZ values = 26
      Levels = 4   XYZ values = 63
      Levels = 5   XYZ values = 124
      Levels = 6   XYZ values = 215
      Levels = 7   XYZ values = 342
      Levels = 8   XYZ values = 511
      Levels = 9   XYZ values = 728
      Levels = 10  XYZ values = 1000

2/ Instead of 'Levels', you pass the function an array of (nx3)
   XYZ values which are then each displayed and measured with the
   photometer.  It then displays a graph showing the difference 
   between 'requested' and 'measured' XYZ values and the check 
   data is also saved in a file in a similar way to option 1/ above.

3/ If you pass the script the name of the file created by options 
   1/ or 2/ above, it will display the data from that file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The graph shows a three-dimensional plot of CIE xyY values.  The 
'requested' values are shown as '.' and the 'measured' values are 
shown as '+'.  A line is also drawn connecting each 'requested' 
value to the corresponding 'measured' value.  If the calibration
and conversion functions are accurate then the lengths of these 
connecting lines should be very small.

You can rotate the three-dimensional graph using the standard
matlab rotate function.

In addition, the maximum xy deviation and the maximum deviation in 
'Y' are also written on the graph.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The script takes the following arguments:-

         dspcheck(DCFname,Levels,PhotometerID,PortNum) or
         dspcheck(DCFname,XYZ,PhotometerID,PortNum) or
         dspcheck(DCKname)

        DCFname = Display calibration file name
         Levels = Number of levels to check
            XYZ = Requested XYZ values
   PhotometerID = Which photometer to use (eg. 'PR650')
        PortNum = COM port for photometer
        DCKname = dspcheck file name
